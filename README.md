# gaussian_beam_profiler
Fit gaussian curves in x and y to the image of a beam and get the 1/e^2 diameters.
## Quick start:
- Download the repository and run **'gaussian_beam_profiler.py'**. The example code at the bottom will import _'beam_profile.tif'_, fit the guassian profiles (_gaussian_fit.png_) and print the beam diameters in x and y.
- The example code **'gaussian_beam_profiler_example.py'** shows how one might use the **'gaussian_beam_profiler.py'** in a lab setting to measure a beam and adjust the diameter with feedback to a precise size (e.g. adjusting a collimator or zoom optic).
